# Modelling Mathematics Performance of Ghanaian Junior High School Students Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the manuscript of my MSc research project, completed at the **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Ghana** in September 2025. The study applies **supervised machine learning techniques** to model and predict the mathematics performance of Junior High School students in Ghana, with a focus on **interpretability, fairness, and responsible deployment**.

## Abstract
Improving student performance in mathematics is a critical goal for education systems, particularly in developing countries.  
We collected data from **364 students** covering **26 socio-economic, demographic, behavioral, and school environment variables**.  
Four supervised machine learning models were applied:
- **Linear Regression** (baseline)  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**  

**Key Findings:**
- Random Forest Regressor outperformed Linear Regression (RÂ² = 0.51 vs. 0.16).  
- Decision Tree achieved **80% accuracy** in classifying Pass/Fail outcomes, outperforming SVM (63%).  
- Important predictors included **class size, distance to school, teacherâ€™s rating, study hours, teacher quality, and socio-economic indicators**.  
- Ethical considerations highlight the importance of using interpretable models to avoid bias and stigmatization.  

## Contribution
- Demonstrates the value of **interpretable ML** in education.  
- Provides **data-driven insights** for targeted interventions (class size reduction, teacher quality improvement, socio-economic support).  
- Connects **technical results** to broader implications for fairness and responsible AI.

- `MANUSCRIPTS.pdf` â€“ Full research manuscript (journal-ready).  
- `Thesis_Summary_AI_Fellowship.pdf` â€“ Concise 1-page summary for fellowship/academic submissions.  

## How This Relates to Cooperative AI
Although focused on education, the work addresses themes central to **AI safety and cooperation**:
- **Interpretability**: Ensuring that models provide actionable, transparent insights.  
- **Fairness**: Considering the risks of bias in sensitive applications like education.  
- **Responsible AI**: Linking technical work to societal and policy implications.
